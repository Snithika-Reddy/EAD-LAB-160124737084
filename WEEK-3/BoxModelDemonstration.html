            <p>Skewness in mathematics is a measure that describes the asymmetry of 
                a probability distribution about its mean. In a perfectly symmetric distribution, such as the normal distribution, the left and right sides are mirror
                images and the skewness value is zero. However, real-life data is rarely perfectly
                balanced. Skewness tells us in which direction and to what extent the data is stretched. If the longer tail of the distribution 
                lies on the right side, the distribution is called positively skewed, meaning a few
                large values pull the mean toward the right. If the longer tail lies on the left,
                it is negatively skewed, where a few small values drag the mean toward the left.
                Skewness is usually calculated using statistical formulas based on deviations
                from the mean, and it can take positive, negative, or zero values.

            <p> Understanding skewness is important because it affects how we interpret 
                data and choose statistical techniques. In a highly skewed distribution,
                the mean, median, and mode are not equal, so the mean may not represent the 
                typical value well. For example, income data is often positively skewed because
                a small number of people earn very high salaries. Skewness also influences 
                decisions in fields like economics, engineering, and data science, where 
                assumptions of normality are required for many tests. By analyzing skewness, 
                we can decide whether to transform the data, use median instead of mean,
                or apply non-parametric methods, making it a key concept in mathematical 
                statistics.</p>
